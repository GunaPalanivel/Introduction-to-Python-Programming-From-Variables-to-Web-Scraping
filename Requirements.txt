YOU WILL NEED A FEW PREREQUISITES IN ORDER TO LEARN PROGRAMMING IN GENERAL, INCLUDING PYTHON. HERE ARE SOME CRUCIAL POINTS:


You must have access to a computer or laptop in order to write and execute code.
 Any current computer should function properly, though 4 GB of RAM is the recommended minimum.

Operating system: 
 Python is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, among other operating systems. You can decide on the option that best suits your needs.

Installation of Python: 
 You must set up Python on your computer. The official Python website offers a free download of the most recent version.

You will require a software program to write and edit your Python code, known as a code editor or an Integrated Development Environment
(IDE). 
 Included in the selection of free IDEs and code editors are Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text.

Internet access is necessary for learning and exploring Python resources, 
 such as online tutorials, reference materials, and examples.

Resources for learning: 
 There are numerous online tutorials, videos, online classes, and books that can be used to learn Python. 
 Find the ones that suit your learning preferences and objectives best.


SUCCESS IN PROGRAMMING ALSO DEPENDS ON HAVING A CURIOUS MINDSET, BEING PERSISTENT, AND BEING OPEN TO TRYING NEW THINGS AND MAKING MISTAKES.
