UTILIZING THE COMMAND PROMPT, YOU CAN PERFORM THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO INSTALL PYTHON ON WINDOWS 11:

INSTALL PYTHON: 
 Download the most recent version of Python for Windows by visiting the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
 If your version of Windows is 64-bit, pick the 64-bit option; otherwise, pick the 32-bit option.

Open the command prompt by pressing the Windows key + R to bring up the Run dialog box, 
 then type "cmd" and hit the Enter key.

Navigate to the Python File You Downloaded: Use the "cd" command to go to the Python file's download directory. 
 You can type "cd Downloads" to go to that directory, for instance, if you downloaded the file to your Downloads folder.

Run the Python Installer: To launch the installer, 
 enter the name of the Python installation file. For instance, 
 you can type "python-3.10.2-amd64.exe" and press Enter if you downloaded the "python-3.10.2-amd64.exe" file.

The Python installer will launch and walk you through the installation procedure; 
 just follow the prompts. To select the installation directory, choose the components to install, 
 and configure any options, simply follow the prompts.

Verify the Installation: 
 Once the installation is complete, start the Python interpreter by typing "python" at the command prompt. 
 This will show that Python is installed. The Python version number and the prompt ">>>" should appear if Python was correctly installed.

I'M DONE NOW! NOW THAT PYTHON SHOULD BE INSTALLED ON YOUR WINDOWS 11 COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BEGIN WRITING PYTHON CODE.
