WHAT PYTHON IS?


Python is a popular high-level, interpreted programming language that is used for many different things,
 including machine learning, data analysis, and web development.

Python is a well-liked alternative for both novice and seasoned programmers due to its famed simplicity,
 readability, and ease of use.

Depending on their talents and experience, 
 Python coders can make competitive pay and are in high demand. The average annual compensation for a Python developer in the United States is roughly $100,000, while some make substantially more, 
 according to data from Glassdoor.


PYTHON IS UTILIZED IN NUMEROUS FIELDS AND OCCUPATIONS, SUCH AS:


Python is used in web development to create APIs and online applications, 
 utilizing well-known frameworks like Flask and Django.

Python is used for data analysis and visualization,
 making use of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning: 
 Python is a popular language for developing AI and machine learning models and training algorithms.

Python is used for simulations and computational modeling in 
 scientific research and engineering.

Education: 
 Because it is simple to learn and has a big community of tools and support, Python is a popular language for teaching programming.
